    <em>Figure 1. With just a single image, SIFU is capable of reconstructing a high-quality 3D clothed human model, making it well-suited for practical applications such as 3D printing and scene creation. At the heart of SIFU is a novel Side-view Conditioned Implicit Function, which is key to enhancing feature extraction and geometric precision. Furthermore, SIFU introduces a 3D Consistent Texture Refinement process, greatly improving texture quality and facilitating texture editing with the help of text-to-image diffusion models. Notably proficient in dealing with complex poses and loose clothing, SIFU stands out as an ideal solution for real-world applications.</em>
